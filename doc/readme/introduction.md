Uses the [mkparse][] library to form a DSL based on tags declared in processing instructions `<? ... ?>`.

Parses and executes processing instructions according to macro functions defined by a grammar; reads newline-delimited JSON records from an input stream, interprets and executes the instructions and writes the modified AST to an output stream.
